# About SMHC

We are excited to bring you the 7th edition of the Singapore Mental Health Conference (SMHC). Since it was first held in 2013, SMHC has become a recognised platform where professionals in the healthcare, social service, and intermediate and long-term care sectors, as well as service users have come together to share insights and exchange ideas to improve the mental health of our population. 

The theme for SMHC 2023 is "Co-Creating Our Mental Health Ecosystem". Through this two-day hybrid conference, we hope to create conversations around the importance of shared understanding and collaboration in addressing our population's mental health needs and building good mental health for all. Central to the conference is the aim to foster partnerships and networks among various sectors to promote mental well-being and resilience, as well as to create an ecosystem that supports and encourages recovery.

The SMHC is co-organised by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Health Promotion Board (HPB), Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and National Council of Social Service (NCSS), with IMH and HPB co-chairing the 2023 edition.
