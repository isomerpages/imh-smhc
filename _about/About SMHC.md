# About SMHC

We are excited to bring you the 5th edition of the Singapore Mental Health Conference (SMHC). This is a platform where professionals in the healthcare, social service, and intermediate- and long-term care sectors, as well as service users, gather to exchange ideas and discuss ways to improve the mental health of our population. More than 500 delegates had a fruitful time at the last edition of SMHC in 2017 and we look forward to your support again in 2023!  

The theme for SMHC 2023 is 'Psychosocial network of support across the lifespan'. Besides forging lively discussions on building resilience in individuals and the community, the conference also explores how empowering individuals and the community could play a crucial role in the recovery process. SMHC 2023 will also foster continuing conversations on how best to deliver mental health care and support across a continuum of settings. Central to the conference is the aim to foster collaborations among the various sectors to build a society that is mentally healthy and resilient, and to create an environment that supports and encourages recovery. Delegates can also look forward to gaining new insights as local and international experts and specialist speakers share their knowledge and expertise in sub-themed plenary and breakout track sessions.

The SMHC is co-organised by the institute of Mental Health (IMH), National Council of Social Service (NCSS), Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), and Health Promotion Board (HPB). with IMH and NCSS co-chairing the 2023 edition.
