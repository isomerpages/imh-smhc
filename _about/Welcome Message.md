# Welcome to SMHC 2023 

It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the 7th edition of the Singapore Mental Health Conference (SMHC). 

Since it was first held in 2013, SMHC has become a recognised national platform where professionals in the healthcare, social service, and intermediate and long-term care sectors, as well as service users come together to share insights and exchange ideas to improve the mental health of our population. 

When we started, SMHC was organised by four main agencies - the Institute of Mental Health, Agency for Integrated Care, Health Promotion Board, and National Council of Social Service. This year, we have the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation, Jardines MINDSET, Singapore Anglican Community Services and Filos Community Services joining the organising committee to design the conference programme. Over the years and editions of SMHC, we are heartened to see various agencies and community partners coming onboard to partner with us to develop a conference that brings together the many players and perspectives that make up our mental health ecosystem. 

This reflects our belief that mental healthcare requires a holistic and multi-agency approach to prevention, recovery, and rehabilitation. We are now in a new era of co-created mental healthcare - one that requires greater integration and collaboration between the health, social and community sectors, workplaces, educational institutions, service users and caregivers, to enable persons with mental health issues to receive care and support in the community and live purposeful lives.

It is apt then that our theme for SMHC 2023 is "Co-Creating Our Mental Health Ecosystem". Through this two-day hybrid conference, we hope to create ongoing conversations around the importance of shared understanding and collaboration in addressing our population's mental health needs and building good mental health for all. We aim to foster partnerships and networks among various sectors to promote mental well-being and resilience, as well as to create an ecosystem that supports and encourages recovery.

To this end, we have lined up notable professionals and experts to share their expertise on a diverse range of topics. There will be sessions on fostering resilience and supportive networks in communities, promoting well-being at the workplace, the growing role of digital tools and services in mental healthcare, improving quality of life for the elderly, and many more.

We hope you will find these topics relevant and thought-provoking and we look forward to seeing you at the conference.
