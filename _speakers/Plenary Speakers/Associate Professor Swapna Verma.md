##### Title: Youth Mental Health Reform: International and National Progress

**Profile:**

After completing her residency training in Psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, USA, A/Prof Swapna Verma started her academic career with the Singapore Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP) at IMH in 2001 when EPIP was first established and thus was closely involved in the development and establishment of its clinical, research and training initiatives. EPIP has won prestigious awards including the WHO award for research in health promotion in 2004 as well as the inaugural National Medical Excellence Team award in 2008. Later, she became the Chief of Department of Psychosis looking at developing innovative care models for schizophrenia and driving research in the field of psychotic disorders. She is the Programme Director of CHAT, a national youth mental health programme, which recently won the National Medical Excellence Team award in 2023. Since December 2020, A/Prof Swapna has been appointed as the Chairman Medical Board of IMH. She&nbsp;is also the Co-Chair of the Implementation Committee looking at Social and Health Integration under the Inter-agency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being.

**Abstract:**

Many studies have shown that the onset of mental health conditions are the highest among young people in their mid-teens to mid-20s (Kessler et al., 2007; Befler, 2008). In the Singapore Mental Health Study conducted in 2016, young people in the 18 to 34 year old age group were found to be more vulnerable to developing mood and anxiety disorders (Subramaniam et al., 2019). 

Despite the high prevalence of mental health issues in young people, professional help seeking remains low. Identified barriers to help seeking for young people include concerns about confidentiality, lack of knowledge about mental health disorders, and financial costs. Mental health services are also not sufficiently differentiated to meet the differing levels of needs, often leading to lack of co-ordinated and quality care.

The two pilot programmes, REACH and CHAT, that were launched under the National Mental Health Blueprint are now part of Singapore’s main-stream services. Both programmes have worked toward addressing barriers to care experienced by distressed youths and these include long waiting times at polyclinic to get subsidised care, cumbersome referral process, limited local youth-specific mental health services and stigma associated with mental health help seeking.

Recently, the Inter-agency Taskforce on Mental Health and Wellbeing has proposed a tiered care model framework for youth mental health to broaden the continuum of mental health services.  IMH is working with key stakeholders to co-create new models of care under the Tiered Care framework by building capability and competency among Social Service Agencies and community partners for better integration of social and mental health services.  Addressing youth mental health offers us our best chance at prevention and early intervention; but it needs us to “think out of the box”, as well as to get young people involved in the planning and design of the care model from the very outset.
