<p id="left">Day 2, 5.00M | Peer Support and How It Compliments Multi-disciplinary Healthcare Services</p>

<b>Profile</b>

Mr. Fahim Fazil is part of the programmes team in Resilience Collective, an IPC registered mental health charity. Through community-drive initiatives and engagement, RC aims to drive meaningful dialogue based on equal partnerships between peers and society, building inclusivity and removing the damaging mentality of “us and them”. 

As part of the programmes team, Fahim is a facilitator for the peer support circles (Circles of Resilience), occasionally leads workshops, and other peer-driven activities. Most of what he does intends to empower the peers and allow them to lead thriving lives. 

His battle with depression for the past 10 years has led him to discover various routes of recovery and has sparked the desire to give back to the community. On a personal note, he is an avid writer and an owner to a beautiful cat named Lucky. 

<b>Abstract</b>

Fahim shares the perspective of a staff member who runs the peers support group meetings (Circles of Resilience). This sharing hopes to bring across the benefits of peer support, the struggles faced and the potential points of improvement.
