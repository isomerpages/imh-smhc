**Abstract**

Ms Robyn Shearer, Deputy Chief Executive and Deputy Director-General System Performance and Monitoring at the Ministry of Health – Aotearoa New Zealand, will explain how New Zealand is transforming the approach to mental health and addiction by ensuring people have more options for accessing the support when and where they need it, including through digital platforms. 

Kia Manawanui Aotearoa, the 10-year strategy underpinning this transformation outlines the cross-government activities needed to promote mental wellbeing for all New Zealanders. This includes a focus on the wider social, economic, cultural and environmental determinants that contribute to health and wellbeing. 

Kia Manawanui identifies technology as a key system enabler for transforming mental health and addiction. This enabler focuses on improving the design and delivery of digital mental health and addiction supports, to enable individuals and whānau to protect and enhance their own wellbeing. Progress towards this has been positive and includes development of the Digital Mental Health &amp; Addiction Tool (DMHAT), an assessment framework for the safe navigation of e-mental health in Aotearoa, as well as investing in a range of digital and telehealth services to expand accessibility and reach for support.
