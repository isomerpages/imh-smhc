Mr Heng ZeChuan is currently a Peer Support Specialist and Recovery Support Manager at PSALT Care, a charity organisation set up to support and sustain persons with diagnosed mental health and addiction challenges in their recovery journey.

He designed and is in charge of the "ASPIRE" Programme, which aims to equip peers with greater awareness and improve their overall wellness and recovery by learning to set and achieve S.M.A.R.T. wellness goals and working on their various dimensions of wellness. He also facilitates peer support groups, social activities, and recovery-based workshops run by PSALT Care.

Prior to this, he worked in a private psychiatric clinic as a clinical assistant, assisting and engaging peer clients and their caregivers in a customer-facing role. He has remained an active volunteer in the mental health sector for the past 9 years and is currently studying for the Higher Diploma in Social Service.

His lived experience with bipolar and anxiety for the past 24 years has instilled in him empathy and a calling to serve those who are vulnerable and disadvantaged. Finding meaning and purpose in the helping profession, he strives to empower and enable fellow peers and seeks to progress with them on a mutually supportive journey of recovery and resilience.
