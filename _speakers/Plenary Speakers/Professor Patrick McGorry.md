<b>Abstract</b>

There is a growing global recognition that the number one health and social challenge facing young people is mental ill-health, but yet everywhere, young people have the worst access to care and the care provided is not fit for purpose, culturally or developmentally appropriate or of acceptable quality. This has spawned a worldwide reform movement led by a blend of clinical research leaders and young people which is building new models of care that are versions of enhanced youth-friendly primary care.

This base camp is evolving and seeks to create a new space in the health system located between childhood and later adulthood, sensitive to the transitional needs, and the force of morbidity that threatens the lives and futures of young people from puberty to independent adulthood.

This paradigm shift has become even more important with the steadily rising rates of mental ill health in young people. Youth mental health is now a moving target. Over the very period that youth mental health services focused on the 12 to 25 year old age transition to adulthood began to be assembled, there has been an alarming rise in the incidence and prevalence of mental ill-health in young people.

The recent Australian National Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing revealed that the prevalence of operationally defined mental disorders in 16 to 24 year-old rose by 50%, from 26% in 2007 to 39% in 2021. The rise in young women was more marked than in young men, with rates reaching 48%. The Australian HILDA survey of 17 000 households/people confirmed a long-term decline in the mental health of this age group.

This survey also captured the additional impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its mitigation strategies. Similar alarming trends had been identified in many other high-income countries well before the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, in an advisory to the United States President and Congress, the US Surgeon General, responding to similar trends in the US, described the situation as a “youth mental health crisis.”

There is a need to focus on prevention and tackle the megatrends in society that are driving this crisis. In addition to new platforms of care there is an equally urgent need for new workforces and for existing disciplines to deepen and expand their expertise in youth mental health.
