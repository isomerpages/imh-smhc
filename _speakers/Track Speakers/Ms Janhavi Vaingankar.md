<b>Profile</b>

Ms Janhavi Vaingankar has over 20 years’ research experience from basic to  mental health services research. Over the past decade, she has focused on psychiatric epidemiology and policy-relevant studies that have addressed real-world challenges faced by individuals with mental disorders and their caregivers. She is a co-investigator on large national studies, including the National Youth Mental Health Study, the Singapore Mental Health Study, the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly study, and the Mind Matters study. These studies have established the prevalence of mental disorders, mental health literacy, and barriers to care in Singapore. Ms Janhavi also leads research on positive mental health at the institute which aims to uncover and measure aspects of mental wellness that are relevant to the local population. She has conducted several studies in this area and identified factors and health outcomes associated with positive mental health in diverse populations. She is currently pursuing a PhD in Public Health from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, where she delves deeper into positive mental health among youth.
