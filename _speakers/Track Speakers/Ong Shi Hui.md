**Topic Title**: Facilitating Change within a Web-Based Single-Session Intervention
	
Ms Ong Shi Hui holds a Bachelor of Social Sciences in Psychology from the National University of Singapore. At CHAT, she  provides in-the-moment emotional support for young people aged between 16 to 30 years old via webCHAT, a synchronous, text-based online mental health support and information service. Naturally attuned to her clients’ unspoken needs, Ms Ong  believes in harnessing the power of safe spaces in inspiring change, such that they feel supported in the process of gaining greater clarity about their mental health concerns.
	
On top of providing brief supportive interventions to distressed young people, she is also passionate about improving mental health literacy among youths and is involved in the organisation’s projects on curating psychoeducational content. To pursue her interests in mental health advocacy, she is also currently involved in a research project aimed at evaluating the effects of youth participation on personal development and the youth mental health landscape. Outside of her professional commitments with CHAT, she volunteers with the Singapore Police Force as a Victim Care Officer, with her responsibilities including the provision of emotional support to victims of sexual crimes.
