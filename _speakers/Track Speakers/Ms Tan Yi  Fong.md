Ms Karen Leow volunteers with the Broken Crayons Still Colour workshop series at Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP) where she shares her knowledge of co-production with the team. She had collaborated with the Co-Production Collective at University College London (UK) and had conducted co-production training sessions locally and abroad (UK). As an ally, she incorporates the values of being human, transparent, inclusive and challenging into everything she does. 
	
Co-production aside, she is passionate about the mental health and cognitive development of children and is currently a Research Associate at the National Institute of Education (NIE). She holds a Master’s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology.
