<b>Profile</b>	
	
As a Co-production Executive with the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP) at IMH, Ms Tan Yi Fong is involved in the advocacy, training, research, and implementation of the department’s co-production efforts. She works closely with her clinician colleagues and volunteers consisting of persons-in-recovery, caregivers, and members of the public to plan, design, develop and deliver psycho-education workshops such as the Broken Crayons Still Colour series. This work is close to her heart as she was a beneficiary of EPIP’s services. Prior to this, she received mentorship as a peer support apprentice and helped to co-plan and co-facilitate psycho-social interventions she used to benefit from.
