<b>Profile</b>	

Mr Caleb Ng is the Managing Director of a US analytical testing company. He is a caregiver to his 28-year-old daughter who experienced psychosis and was diagnosed in 2012. His first contact with Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP) was through the Broken Crayons workshop series in June 2022. The programme left such an impression that he volunteered in the subsequent two rounds of Broken Crayons. In 2023, Caleb also volunteers with EPIP as a Caregiver Peer Support Specialist where he supports fellow caregivers. He firmly believes in early intervention and working in tandem with healthcare support initiatives like EPIP and co-production.
