Ms Amaranta Lim is part of the Partnership and Engagement team of the Youth Division. She works with her teammates on the Singapore Mental Well Being Network with a focus on strengthening community and peer support, and rolling out awareness and engagement initiatives. Ms Lim also works hand in hand with the National Youth Council on issues that are of interest to youths, for instance mental well-being, through youth engagement, policy planning, and participatory platforms such as the Youth Action Challenge.

Before joining the Ministry, she had taken on different roles in arts and heritage, publishing, hospitality, and healthcare in companies such as the National Museum of Singapore and the National University Hospital. The diversity in work environments and roles has helped in developing an empathetic and deeper understanding of the different needs in various communities. 

Driven by a combination of curiosity about people and the intricacies of human behaviours, and a passion in helping and connecting people, she has degrees in Sociology and Southeast Asian Studies, and Psychology from the National University of Singapore and the University of Melbourne. She has been a regular volunteer at the Institute of Mental Health for the past 10 years, and is often seeking authentic conversations and insights with local communities when on her breaks at off-the-beaten track locations outside of Singapore.
