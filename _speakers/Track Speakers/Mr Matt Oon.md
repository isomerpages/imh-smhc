Mr Matt Oon’s social enterprise, Acceset, has developed a suite of indigenous communication software tools to address unmet social needs. He believes that technology has the power to transform the role that individuals can play in contributing to a more robust care ecosystem, which includes going beyond a passive role as a “patient” or “referral” to an active provider and co-creator of care. 
	
He has partnered with various institutes of higher learning on pilot projects as well as research work, both locally and internationally. He also worked closely with various social service agencies to co-develop and co-deliver upstream programs for youth mental wellness.
In his sharing session, titled “Collaborations as key drivers of Growth within the social sector”, he will share how he prepared himself to secure strategic partnerships. Partnerships happen based on trust, and the prospect of delivering good results. Having a framework to quickly establish a shared understanding of the culture of the ecosystem that one works within is a key factor in winning partnerships and collaborations. He will share the core approaches and principal questions and the framework for how to do so, which has helped him to engage effectively with prospective funders, customers or partners in the education and healthcare space.
