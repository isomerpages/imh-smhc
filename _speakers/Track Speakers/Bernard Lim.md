Mr Bernard Lim joined Dementia Singapore in Dec 2022 and oversees all aspects of media for the agency.
	
He also leads CARA, a lifestyle and community digital platform that provides 
access for persons living with dementia and caregivers to connect to an ecosystem
of solutions via a mobile application.

In the World Alzheimer’s month of September , he kicked off a series of “Back to the
Heartlands” outreach projects by taking Dementia Singapore to the communities,
engaging the heartlanders and spreading dementia awareness on the ground.

He has more than 20 years in the media and entertainment industry. The reason he
left the commercial media industry to join Dementia Singapore was to take on more
purposeful work and reach out to help people living with dementia and their
caregivers.
