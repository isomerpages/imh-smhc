**Topic Title:**  S17 Community Kitchen Initiative by The Saturday Movement

In 2010, Mr Raymond Khoo established The Saturday Movement, a grassroots initiative, which has now evolved into a registered charity, aimed at addressing food insecurity and social isolation among the elderly in Lengkok Bahru. Recognising that Saturdays are often lonely for seniors, Mr Khoo and his team organised weekly events that brought together volunteers to distribute bread, fruits and free meals to the elderly residents. 
	
Building on the success of the Saturday Movement, hewent on to establish the S17 Community Kitchen, a dedicated space that serves as both a communal kitchen and an informal centre for elderly care. The kitchen not only continues the tradition of preparing and distributing free meals but also offers a range of programs and activities to enhance the well-being of the elderly residents. Through its social community events, the S17 Community Kitchen has become a vital hub for fostering connections and promoting healthy aging.
Raymond's passion for social entrepreneurship and his commitment to uplifting the elderly have earned him accolades and recognition. His innovative approach to tackling social issues has inspired others to get involved and make a difference in their own communities.
