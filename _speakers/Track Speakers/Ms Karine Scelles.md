Ms Karine Scelles has more than 20 years of Human Resources experience. Based in Singapore since 2008, she currently heads the Asia Pacific HR function for Otis Elevator Co., the world’s leading manufacturer and maintainer of elevators and escalators. What the Otis colleagues do in this business matters: everyday they enable 2 billion people to move safely.

Prior to this role, she worked in Alstom and in General Electric, where she had global and regional roles and led major business and cultural transformations. The red thread throughout her career has been a relentless appetite for organisation and people development, through a pragmatic and humanist approach. Her personal motto is “People are not resources… they have resources”.

She has been a passionate advocate of building mentally healthy and thriving workplaces and communities as a leadership priority, and is an active volunteer in the WorkWell Leaders. In March 2023, Otis Asia-Pacific won the first WorkWell Leaders Corporate Wellbeing Strategy award, recognising how Otis positions wellbeing as a strategic business priority and opportunity.

Ms Scelles holds a master’s degree in Philosophy and another one in Instructional design; she is also a certified Master Practitioner in Neuro-Linguistic Programing.
