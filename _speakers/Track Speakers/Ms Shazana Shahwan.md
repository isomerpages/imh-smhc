**Topic Title:**  A school-based mental health literacy programme for youths: Barriers and facilitators to implementation
	
Ms Shazana Shahwan holds a Masters degree in Psychology. Her work over the past decade involves supporting IMHâ€™s nationwide epidemiological research studies that established the prevalence of various mental illnesses in Singapore. She led a team to understand the role of stigma in mental health literacy and help-seeking behaviours through a qualitative inquiry. She has been part of teams that designed and evaluated anti-stigma interventions. Through recent opportune partnerships, Ms Shazana and her team embarked on an implementation research journey, allowing them to gain perspective on factors that influence the running of mental health programmes on the ground.
