<b>Profile</b>	

Mid 2023, Mr Muhamad Shafiq graduated from Singapore Polytechnic (SP) with a diploma in Civil Engineering. While he was in SP, he was elected president of the SP Peer Support club or SPPS. Under his bold and creative leadership, he led the club to foster strong relationships within the club and across the school community as he knew that relationships were the basic building block for students’ well-being. 
Now serving NS, he continues to serve as advisor to the SP Peer Support Club, and as a peer supporter in Singapore Civil Defence Force.
