**Topic Title:** Trajectories of Emotional &amp; Behavioural Resilience in Out-of-Home Care Children

Dr Zhou Quanâ€™s  research looks at the well-being of different population segments in Singapore, including quality of life of caregivers, the impact of COVID-19 on quality of life of vulnerable populations, public attitudes towards persons with mental health conditions, and longitudinal development of children in out-of-home care. These studies have informed social service planning and public education campaigns across government agencies, public and community stakeholders.
