<b>Profile</b>	

Ms Jie Ying has been the Peer Support Program (PSP) Coordinator with Tan Tock Seng Hospital since 2010 and currently leads her team from HR Well-being to focus on staff’s mental wellbeing. As the PSP Coordinator, her work allows her to reach out to staff from all walks of life who may be going through some difficulties at work or their personal life. This led to her interest in discovering how could she better workplace mental health and provide beyond emotional support to staff. She is trained in Mental Health First Aid and Crisis Intervention for the workplace.
