Mr Danny Loke is a registered social service practitioner and a certified behavioural consultant with 16 years of experience in the social service sector. Trained in psychology and Dynamic Assessment using Mediated Constructivism Theory, he has headed programmes for adults with special needs in his previous work and has had past experiences of working with individuals with comorbid mental health conditions.

He currently oversees  Community Intervention Team (COMIT) and Community Outreach Team (CREST) to bring mental health services and resources to the community. He hopes that persons at risk of mental health conditions can have access to preventive or early intervention; and together with their caregivers who receive care and support, they can be empowered to live with dignity within the community.
