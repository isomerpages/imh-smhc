<b>Profile</b>	

Ms Ang Suying’s social work background has influenced her to be a change agent through the empowerment of service users. As a case manager in the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme for the past 16 years, she works with young persons aged 12 – 40 years old who experience psychosis, supporting them and their caregivers. She provides clinical supervision and takes an administrative lead to the team of allied health professionals in EPIP. Having established the peer support service in EPIP, her focus now lies in sustaining recovery-oriented practices like user involvement and co-creation.
