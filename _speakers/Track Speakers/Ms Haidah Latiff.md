Ms Haidah Latiff is a person-in-recovery and has used her lived experiences to empathise with and connect to others in similar situations. In addition to volunteering with the Broken Crayons Still Colour workshop series, she had contributed to peer support work as an apprentice with the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP) at IMH.  She co-facilitated workshops emphasizing the importance of reminding oneself and others that no one is alone in their recovery journeys as well as combatting the stigma attached to mental health. She is committed to uplifting those dealing with mental health struggles to sharing the hope that recovery is possible for everyone.
