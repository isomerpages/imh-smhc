Through her work in TOUCH Community Services over the past 7 years, Ms Jennifer Koh has developed a critical appreciation of social issues affecting the vulnerable populations. That, coupled with an empathetic belief that solutions may be found within the communities, inspires her to journey with TOUCHâ€™s direct services, academic and community partners for research collaborations as well as evidence-informed programme design, monitoring and evaluation to impact lives. Her current research interests include social inequality, mental wellness, practice research, and community development. Ms Koh holds a Bachelor of Social Sciences (Sociology) from the National University of Singapore, and is pursuing a part-time Master of Science in Knowledge Management at the Nanyang Technological University.
