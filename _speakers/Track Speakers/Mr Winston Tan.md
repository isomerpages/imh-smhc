<b>Profile</b>	

Mr Winston Tan is a volunteer and a community peer supporter with Youth Corps Singapore’s (YCS) Project Re:ground, a programme that advocates for the importance of youth mental well-being and peer support as a life skill. His passion in advocating for mental well-being has led him to volunteer with the Institute of Mental Health and become an EXCO member of the Youth Corps Mental Health Cluster since his days as a university student, and now, a working adult.

As a peer supporter, Mr Tan believes that peer support allows him to be there for the people that matter to him and the community he believes in. He is happy to let them know they are not alone in their challenges and that there are ways to reach out. His belief in peer support is further reinforced through his interactions with those closest to him and also through his volunteering experiences as he has learnt how powerful it can be to provide that space and also influence others to do the same for their friends as well. These interactions with the community have also taught him how to build his own support systems and practise self-care for his own well-being.
