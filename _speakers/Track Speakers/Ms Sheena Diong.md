Ms Sheena Diong is a Children and Teen's Librarian at the National Library Board by day and an aspiring mental health practitioner by night. She is currently a Public Service Division (PSD) Wellness Ambassador (WA) and has also worked with the Whole-of-Government (WOG) WA Taskforce to produce a set of Resource Kits for current and future WA to utilise in their journey in helping others. When she is not engaging children and teens at work, Ms Diong is trying to finish up her Master of Arts (Counselling and Guidance) at the National Institute of Education (NIE).

Ms Diong will be speaking about her experiences as a WA and the initiatives that she has been a part of that has helped contribute to a greater focus on mental health in our workplaces.
