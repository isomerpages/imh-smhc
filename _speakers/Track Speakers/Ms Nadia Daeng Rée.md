Ms Nadia Daeng Rée grew up with an older sibling who started receiving treatment from IMH in 1995. Having come across Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL) in 2016, she enrolled in their programmes to cope with caregiver burnout. Over the years, she stayed actively involved as a Volunteer Trainer with the organisation, including support for various CAL outreach and engagement initiatives.

She graduated in 2004 from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a Diploma in Mass Communication. Armed with her career experience that spans two decades working on communications and corporate development for MNC companies in the private sector, she recently joined CAL as full-time staff and now leverages her professional skills to advocate for caregivers and mental health literacy. Motivated by her own family’s lived experiences, she believes in taking a holistic approach to educate different sectors of our society on the importance of mental health; aimed at elevating awareness for the continued support that caregivers need within our communities.
