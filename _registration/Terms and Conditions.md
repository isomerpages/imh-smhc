<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither Party shall
transfer or assign all or any of its rights, obligations or benefits hereunder
in whole or in part to any third party, without the prior written consent
of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any permitted assignee
or transferee shall agree in writing to comply with all the provisions
of these Terms; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any assignment shall not exceed the existing scope of these Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>R. SEVERABILITY</u>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that any term, condition or provision
contained in these Terms or the application of any such term, condition
or provision shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be wholly
or partly illegal, invalid, unenforceable or a violation of any applicable
law, statute or regulation of any jurisdiction, the same shall be deemed
to be deleted from these Terms and shall be of no force and effect; whereas
the remaining terms, conditions or provisions of these Terms shall remain
in full force and effect as if such term, condition and provision had not
originally been contained in these Terms, unless the severed provisions
render the continuing performance of these Terms impossible, or materially
change either Party’s rights or obligations under these Terms; in which
event such Party may give written notice of its intent to terminate these
Terms to the other Party.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the aforesaid, in the event
of such deletion, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to agree
to terms of mutually acceptable and satisfactory alternative provision(s)
in place of the provision(s) so deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>S. NO PARTNERSHIP</u>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing contained in or relating to these Terms
shall be deemed to constitute a partnership or a principal-agent relationship
between the Parties and no Party shall have any authority to act or assume
any obligation or responsibility of any kind, express or implied, on behalf
of the other Party or bind or commit the other Party for any purpose in
any way whatsoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>T. NO THIRD (3RD) PARTY BENEFICIARIES</u>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing contained in these Terms is intended
to confer upon any person (other than the Parties hereto) any rights, benefits
or remedies of any kind or character whatsoever or any right to enforce
the terms of this Terms and Conditions under the Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act 2001, and no person shall be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary
under or by reason of these Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>U. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</u>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of any dispute or difference arising
out of or in connection with or in relation to these Terms, including any
question regarding the existence, validity, termination, application or
interpretation of these Terms or any of its provisions or any claim, disagreement
or dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach of any
of its provisions, both Parties shall use their best endeavours to settle
the dispute informally by agreement between the Parties. Both Parties shall
always act in good faith and co-operate with each other to resolve any
disputes.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, if
the dispute is not settled informally in accordance with Clause U(1), no
Party shall proceed to litigation or any other form of dispute resolution
unless the Parties have made reasonable efforts to resolve the same through
mediation, in accordance with the mediation rules of the Singapore Mediation
Centre. A Party who receives a notice for mediation from the other Party
shall consent and participate in the mediation process in good faith in
accordance with this clause. The Parties undertake to abide by the terms
of any settlement reached. Failure to comply with this Clause shall be
deemed to be a breach of these Terms.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that mediation is unsuccessful,
the dispute shall be resolved either by reference to arbitration or by
court proceedings as elected by either Party, by way of a written notice
to the other Party, which shall state the specific dispute to be resolved
and the nature of such dispute. Should the Parties fail to agree to refer
the dispute to arbitration, either Party may institute an action in court.
The Parties agree, in such event, to submit irrevocably to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the Courts of the Republic of Singapore to settle any and
all disputes in connection with these Terms.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any reference to arbitration in Singapore shall
be a submission to arbitration within the meaning of the Arbitration Act
2001 for the time being in force in Singapore. Such arbitration shall be
conducted in the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules
of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the
time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference
into this clause, except in so far as such Rules conflict with the express
provisions of this clause, in which event the provisions of this clause
will prevail.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that
nothing in this Clause shall prevent a Party from seeking urgent equitable
relief before any appropriate court and the commencement of any dispute
resolution proceedings shall in no way affect the continual performance
of the Parties’ obligations under these Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>V. GOVERNING LAW</u>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Terms and Conditions shall be deemed to
be made in Singapore, subject to, governed by and construed in all respects
in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore for every intent
and purpose.</p>
