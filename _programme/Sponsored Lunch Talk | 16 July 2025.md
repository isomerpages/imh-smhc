<h4><strong>Title:</strong> Unmasking the Hidden Burden in Bipolar I Depression</h4>
<h4><br><strong>Speaker:</strong> <strong>Dr Nisha Chandwani,</strong> <em>Senior Consultant, Institute of Mental Health</em></h4>
<h4><br><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>
<p>Bipolar I depression is often under-recognized and misdiagnosed due to
its overlapping features with unipolar depression and its multifaceted
symptomatology. This presentation aims to enhance clinical understanding
of the hidden symptom burden in Bipolar I disorder, particularly focusing
on features associated with poorer outcomes, increased suicidality, and
functional impairment. Diagnostic challenges, including delayed recognition
and inadequate response to traditional treatments, further compound the
disease burden. Recent advances have highlighted the role of the dopamine
D3-receptor system in mediating core symptoms such as reward dysfunction,
anhedonia, anxiety, cognitive deficits, among others. Emerging therapies
that preferentially target D3 receptors—such as cariprazine—demonstrate
promise in addressing these unmet needs, offering symptom relief and functional
recovery. By unmasking the nuanced and debilitating features of Bipolar
I depression and aligning treatment strategies with underlying neurobiology,
clinicians may be better equipped to deliver individualized, outcome-focused
care.</p>
