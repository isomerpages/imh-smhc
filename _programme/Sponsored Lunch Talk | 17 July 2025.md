<h4><strong>Title: </strong>Connecting the Dots: LATUDA at the Intersection of Metabolism, Cognition, and Schizophrenia Symptom Control<br><br><strong>Speaker: </strong>Assoc. Prof Dr. Pongsatorn Paholpak (Psychiatrist, Khon Kean University Thailand)</h4>
<h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>
<p>Treating schizophrenia effectively requires more than just controlling
positive symptoms-clinicians must also consider the broader impact on patients'
cognitive function and metabolic health, which significantly influence
long-term outcomes, functional recovery, and quality of life. However,
many antipsychotic treatments are associated with metabolic side effects
and cognitive dulling, complicating disease management.
<br>This presentation explores how LATUDA (Lurasidone) stands at the intersection
of this complex triangle, offering a balanced approach to schizophrenia
treatment. With a favourable metabolic profile, minimal impact on weight
and lipids, and evidence supporting cognitive benefit, LATUDA helps clinicians
"connect the dots" between symptom control, cognitive preservation, and
metabolic safety. The session will also highlight clinical data, comparative
insights with other antipsychotics, and the implications for holistic,
recovery-oriented care in schizophrenia.
<br>Lastly, this is followed by a case study sharing of LATUDA use in schizophrenia
patient with metabolic and cognition concern (younger patient) and how
LATUDA helps this patient to connect the dots of metabolic, cognition and
schizophrenia symptoms control.</p>
