<p>Rebecca Loh is a member of CAL’s Circles of Resilience support group programme
which helps her manage an eating disorder.</p>
<p>In secondary school, Rebecca’s relationship with food took a drastic turn,
when she started picking at her food and counting calories. Exercising
excessively, she found herself getting cold easily, slower, less agile
and more easily tired. Unable to cope with the impending examinations,
she eventually applied for a leave of absence from school. Seeking a supportive
community, Rebecca joined a Support Group CR where she found comfort in
shared experiences. Week by week, she opened up about her struggles, realising
that speaking up not only helped her heal but also encouraged others to
seek support. Through the programme, she built meaningful friendships and
regained the confidence to move forward. Now a support group facilitator,
Rebecca enjoys advocating for mental health and is also pursuing a master’s
in counselling. Her journey is testament to the power of community support
in mental health recovery.</p>
