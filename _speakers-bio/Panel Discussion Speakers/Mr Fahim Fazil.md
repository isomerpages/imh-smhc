<p>Mr Fahim Fazil is a Programme Manager with Caregivers Alliance Limited’s
(CAL) support group programme, Circles of Resilience, which offers a safe
and supportive space for peers to connect and share their recovery journeys.
Held monthly with regular, familiar groups, these sessions foster a sense
of belonging and trust, allowing participants to build meaningful, close-knit
relationships. By showing up for themselves and their peers, they support
each other to progress in their mental health journeys together. Fahim
facilitates peer support circles attended by young adults struggling with
mental health, and occasionally leads workshops and other peer-driven engagement
activities, all aimed at empowering peers – individuals who are diagnosed
with mental health conditions or seeking support - to lead thriving lives.
<br>A person in recovery himself, Fahim’s battle with depression for the last
decade has led him to discover various routes of recovery, igniting his
desire to give back to the community. Fahim is an avid writer and a fur
parent to his cat, Lucky.</p>
