<p>Mdm Yew Woon Wah is a mother of 5 children, including Rebecca Loh, who
has been managing an eating disorder since her teenage years. Determined
to support Rebecca’s recovery, Mdm Yew has made significant sacrifices,
even leaving her job to ensure Rebecca never had to eat alone, even at
school, or on internships. To be a better caregiver to her daughter, she
attended the 12-week Caregivers-to-Caregivers (C2C) Training Programme,
where she connected with other caregivers navigating similar challenges.
<br>A selfless mother, Mdm Yew is still working on how she can love her children
equally while recognising their individual personalities and needs. When
not working in the healthcare sector, she enjoys hiking and stair-climbing.
At 58, she has started planning her bucket list, where hiking to Everest
base camp is one of the items she aspires to check off.</p>
