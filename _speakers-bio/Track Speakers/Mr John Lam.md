<p>Track Title: SOS CareText: Connecting Care with Technology in Times of
Crisis
<br>Date: 16 July 2025, Wednesday
<br>Time: 2.05 PM
<br>Breakout Session: Track 1 – Digital Mental Health &amp; Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>
<br>In 2020, SOS found that 67% of students preferred text messaging as their
go-to method for seeking help. Recognising this need, SOS launched CareText,
a 24/7 text-based support service, staffed by trained volunteers and professionals
via the SOS website and WhatsApp. Since then, the overwhelming response
has confirmed the demand for text-based crisis support—in the past year
alone (ending March 2024), SOS received over 21,000 chats, primarily from
young people at risk of suicide.
<br>In this session, SOS will present a recent study revealing that service
users find CareText highly effective. Through an immersive experience,
participants will gain valuable insights into texting strategies for supporting
distressed individuals — skills they can apply directly in their work.
<br>Looking ahead, SOS envisions a future where AI technology enhances SOS’s
ability to support clients, train volunteers, and manage workload more
efficiently. This session will offer a glimpse into SOS’s latest AI-driven
ideas, exploring how technology can strengthen suicide prevention efforts
in the digital age.</p>
