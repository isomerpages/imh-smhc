<p>Track Title: The Importance of Caregiver Support: “Every Caregiver Matters”
<br>Date: 17 July 2025, Thursday
<br>Time: 11.15 AM
<br>Breakout Session: Track 4 – Voices From The Community</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>
<br><strong><u>THE IMPORTANCE OF CAREGIVER SUPPORT: “EVERY CAREGIVER MATTERS”</u></strong>
<br>Research has indicated that social support acts as a buffer against many
negative health repercussions on caregivers.</p>
<p>At Club HEAL, the team recognises the impact on the emotional and mental
health of caregivers as they journey along the endless road of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Many share their personal caregiving experiences through bumps and tested
ways of dealing with roadblocks and vent their frustrations as the pathway
is very overwhelming, but they are not daunted.</p>
<p>Through Club HEAL’sCREST Caregiver Support Network (CSN), it aims to make
a difference for caregivers. With access to resources like respite care,
support groups and education, caregivers can feel less isolated and more
equipped to manage their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Emotional support from our caregiver advocates and professionals creates
a safe space to share their struggles, celebrate small victories and to
learn from others facing similar challenges.</p>
<p>Practical resources, such as workshops and training, help our caregivers
build the skills they need to navigate complex situations with patience,
dedication, compassion and empathy.</p>
