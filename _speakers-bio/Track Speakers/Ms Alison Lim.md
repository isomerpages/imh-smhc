<p>On a family trip in 2012, Alison mistakenly called guacamole - "Guatemale".&nbsp;Recognising
the signs from her husband’s family history of dementia, Alison sought
help.
<br>In 2016, Alison was diagnosed with a rare dementia called Primary Progressive
Aphasia (PPA). She was in her 50s. Unable to find support, Alison "stalked"
young-onset dementia persons (people diagnosed before 65) outside clinics
to invite them home to further understand this confusing journey. She was
also very fortunate to meet scientists, researchers, and neurologists,
including the professor who coined the term "PPA".
<br>Shortly after her diagnosis, Alison and her daughter Jamie started Dementia
&amp; Co, a support network for raising dementia awareness and helping
families navigate similar challenges. To date, they have worked with over
200 families, supporting each other with the acronym T.R.E.E.E.S. - Trust,
Respect and Remember for us to Engage, Enjoy, Encircle Safe.</p>
<p><strong>Hopes</strong>
<br>Alison’s dream for a Dementia-Friendly Singapore is where people, society
are excited to meet and connect with persons living with dementia. Through
Dementia &amp; Co, Alison wants to help create support groups for newly
diagnosed individuals and their families across Singapore - in every HDB
block, Tea Dance session, community club, active aging centre, and hospital.
The goal is to remove stigma and replace society’s fear of dementia with
fun and joy.</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>
<br>Through this symposium, Alison hopes to highlight the importance of "self-care,
mutual respect and mutual support" for everyone involved with the dementia
community - medical professionals, care agencies, persons living with dementia
and their families. Alison hopes that this symposium will also be the beginning
of open dialogues and fun collaborations. Together, we can reinforce the
spirit of a Dementia-Friendly Singapore.</p>
