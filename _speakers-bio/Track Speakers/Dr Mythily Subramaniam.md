<p>Track Title: WISE Study: Dementia and Depression in Older Adults
<br>Date: 16 July 2025, Wednesday
<br>Time: 5.05 PM
<br>Breakout Session: Track 2 – Emerging Trends &amp; Insights</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>
<br>Over the past decade, global dementia prevalence has continued to rise,
driven by population aging, improved diagnostic recognition, and evolving
risk factor profiles. While overall prevalence rates have increased, some
high-income countries have reported a stabilisation or decline, potentially
due to improved cardiovascular health, higher education levels, and public
health interventions. In contrast, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
are experiencing sharper rises due to demographic shifts and persistent
modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and air pollution.
Emerging evidence also highlights lifestyle factors, genetic predispositions,
and social determinants as crucial contributors to dementia risk. Advances
in large-scale epidemiological studies and predictive&nbsp; modelling have
further refined our understanding of these trends. This talk will explore
recent findings on dementia prevalence, key risk and protective factors,
and implications for future prevention and intervention strategies.</p>
