<p>Track Title: Prevalence of Mental Health Conditions in Youth and Emerging
Trends in Singapore
<br>Date: 17 July 2025, Thursday
<br>Time: 3.40 PM
<br>Breakout Session: Track 2 – Emerging Trends &amp; Insights</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>
<br>Youth is a critical life stage, marked by rapid changes in academic, social,
and emotional environments of individuals. These often have long-lasting
influences on their mental health and adult life. The incidence of mental
health disorders peaks during the transition from childhood to adulthood,
with up to one fourth of youths experiencing significant mental health
problems before they turn 25. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and worsening
international turmoil have shone a spotlight on youth mental health like
never before. Despite these critical drivers, most youths do not seek appropriate
and timely treatment, resulting in adverse health outcomes and disease
burden. The National Youth Mental Health Study was a cross-sectional survey
of 2600 nationally representative youths that established the prevalence
of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms among Singaporean youths, identified
psychosocial risk and protective factors and investigated mental healthcare
service use patterns in this population. The speaker will present findings
from this study and draw comparisons with the global youth mental health
situation.</p>
