<p>Joseph is the co-founder and CEO of Kaleidoscope Labs, an organisation
driving innovation in mental health and workplace well-being. In 2023,
Kaleidoscope was appointed by the Tripartite Alliance to manage the Well-being
Champions Network (WCN), Singapore’s largest workplace well-being network.
In under a year, the WCN has grown to 450 Champions from 700 organisations,

Safety and Health Council. Joseph also contributes to national mental health
