<p>Track Title: Loneliness and Social Isolation among Older Adults: Evidence
from Singapore
<br>Date: 16 July 2025, Wednesday
<br>Time: 2.35 PM
<br>Breakout Session: Track 2 – Emerging Trends &amp; Insights</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>
<br>Loneliness (a subjective state reflecting the perceived extent of the
lack of meaningful social relationships) and social isolation (an objective
state of having few social relationships or infrequent social contact)
are important psychosocial health states among older adults, both in of
themselves and as predictors of other adverse health outcomes. In this
talk, Dr. Malhotra will present empirical data from studies of older adults
conducted by the Centre for Ageing Research and Education (CARE) in Singapore
on the extent of and overlap between loneliness and social isolation, the
impact of loneliness and social isolation on two important population health
indicators (life expectancy and health expectancy), and the lived experience
of loneliness and social isolation and its implications for interventions
to address them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
