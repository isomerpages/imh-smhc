<p>Dr. Min Yi SUM is currently a senior research specialist in NCSS. Her
current role includes investigating the quality of life of the general
population and vulnerable segments within the population to identify the
trends and changing needs of these groups. Her passion lies in mental health
awareness and her research interests include mental health stigma and quality
of life of both individuals with mental illness and those of the general
population. Her exposure to patients with psychotic disorders while working
as a research officer in the Institute of Mental Health and pursuing her
PhD in the University of Hong Kong has heightened her awareness to the
experiences of these individuals. She has also authored and co-authored
multiple peer-reviewed publications on the topics of stigma and quality
of life in both patients with psychotic disorders and the general population.</p>
