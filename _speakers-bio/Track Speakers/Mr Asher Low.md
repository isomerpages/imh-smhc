<p>The founder and current Executive Director of Limitless, Asher is a social
worker with over fifteen years of experience working with young people.
He also has clinical tenures in the family, prisons and youth sectors.
<br>Asher has a dedicated passion to help youths who struggle with mental
health conditions, and has spearheaded research, advocacy, and public education
efforts to help promote help-seeking behaviour, reduce stigma in youths,
and improve public knowledge and skills in trauma-informed care.
<br>Having served on several interagency committees and workgroups on mental
health, Asher works closely with other leaders in government, statutory
boards, and other social service agencies in the mental health landscape
to explore how we can build a better ecosystem of support for people with
mental health conditions, make help seeking easier, as well as facilitate
prevention of said mental health conditions.</p>
