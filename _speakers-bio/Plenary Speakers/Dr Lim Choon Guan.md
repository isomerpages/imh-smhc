<p>Plenary Title: The Use of Technology in Child &amp; Adolescent Mental
Health Service
<br>Date: 16 July 2025, Wednesday
<br>Time: 11.40 AM</p>
<p><strong><u>Plenary Abstract</u></strong>
<br>The Child Guidance Clinic is the largest provider of child and adolescent
psychiatry service in Singapore. In this talk, Dr Lim will share the clinic’s
experience in research and clinical service delivery which utilised various
technologies. The first long-running project investigated the brain computer
interface (BCI) to develop an attention training program for the treatment
of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the product is now
commercially available. He will highlight the results of their trials,
including the randomised controlled trial, and some of the challenges faced
along this journey. The same technology has been investigated in the treatment
of other conditions including autism spectrum disorder and anxiety disorder.
The pandemic also accelerated the progress of tele-consultation which has
now become one option for access to mental health service in our clinic.</p>
