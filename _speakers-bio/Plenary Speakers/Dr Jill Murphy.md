<p>Plenary Title: The APEC Digital Hub for Mental Health: Leveraging Digital
Technologies to Promote Equitable Access to Mental Health Promotion and
Care in the APEC Region
<br>Date: 16 July 2025, Wednesday
<br>Time: 9.25AM</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Plenary Abstract</strong>
<br>The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Digital Hub for Mental Health
(‘the Digital Hub’) is hosted in Canada with the collaboration of people
with lived and living experiences, researchers, clinicians, and policy
makers from across the APEC region. The <em>2021-2030 Roadmap to Promote Mental Wellness in a Healthy Asia Pacific</em> (‘the
Roadmap’) represents an ongoing commitment by APEC member economies to
continue strengthening mental health systems and promoting well-being in
support of sustainable economic growth. The <em>Roadmap</em> acknowledges
the potential of digital technologies to support access to mental health
promotion, prevention, screening and treatment across several priority
focus areas.
<br>
</p>
<p>Digital technologies are increasingly recognised as effective and acceptable
methods of delivering mental health prevention, promotion and care interventions.
Despite this, ongoing efforts are required to understand how these can
be delivered equitably among diverse populations, and how to promote uptake,
engagement and sustained implementation by patients, clinicians and health
systems. The Digital Hub has undertaken several collaborative research
studies to leverage digital mental health technologies as a means of promoting
equitable access to mental health promotion and care in the APEC region.
This talk will provide an overview of this work, touching on several regional
priority areas. This includes results from the Technology and Equitable
Access to Mental Health in the Asia Pacific (TEAM-CAP) study, which examined
challenges and opportunities to promote equitable access to digital mental
health technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. It will also
describe the Youth Promotion of Resilience Involving Mental e-Health (Y-PRIME)
study, which seeks to promote youth well-being and resilience via a co-designed
app for secondary school students in Vietnam. Reflections and recommendations
about promoting mental health equity and the sustained uptake of digital
mental health technologies within diverse contexts will be provided.</p>
