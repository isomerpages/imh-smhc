<p>Plenary Abstract</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming many aspects of our
lives, and healthcare stands out as one of the key fields experiencing
profound changes. Mental health care, in particular, is poised to significantly
benefit from advancements in AI. In this talk, Professor Guan will provide
an overview of how AI is transforming mental health care through applications
such as the early detection of mental disorders, generative AI—including
natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs)—for
mental health interventions, chatbots and virtual therapists, and the integration
of wearable technology with AI to monitor and support mental well-being.
Additionally, he will share ongoing research from my lab related to mental
healthcare using AI and brain-computer interface technologies.</p>
